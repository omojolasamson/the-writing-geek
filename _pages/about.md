I'm a Software Engineer based in Illinois, USA. I currently work at Tech365. I love creating applications with responsive, beautiful, intuitive, state-of-the-art designs. I have a passion for helping companies deliver amazing digital experiences to their users.

When I build applications, I prioritise scalability and target audience. I'm skilled in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ionic, React, PHP, Laravel, and Flutter. I'm also a technical writer with decent WordPress skills. I'm a team player and an excellent communicator. I have an Electrical/Electronics Engineering degree from University of Ilorin.
